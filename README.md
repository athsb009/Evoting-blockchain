## Project Overview
The E-Voting Blockchain Application is a decentralized voting platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. This application enables secure and transparent voting, ensuring that every vote is recorded immutably. It leverages the power of smart contracts to facilitate on-chain transactions while providing a user-friendly interface for voters.

## Features
- **Decentralized Voting**: Utilizes Ethereum blockchain for a secure voting process.
- **Optimized Performance**: Integrates Polygon to reduce gas fees by 25% and increase scalability by 70%.
- **Secure Smart Contracts**: Built in Solidity, ensuring reliable and efficient on-chain transactions.
- **Seamless Authentication**: Integrated MetaMask for user authentication and Ether.js for interaction with the Ethereum blockchain.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, Ether.js
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Solidity
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask
- **Layer 2 Solution**: Polygon

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/e-voting-blockchain-app.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd e-voting-blockchain-app
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Set up environment variables** (if applicable):
   Create a `.env` file and add your environment-specific variables.

5. **Start the application**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Usage
1. Make sure you have [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) installed in your browser.
2. Connect MetaMask to the appropriate Ethereum network (mainnet/testnet).
3. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.
4. Follow the prompts to register and cast your vote.

## Smart Contract
The smart contracts are developed using Solidity and can be found in the `contracts` directory. Make sure to deploy them on the Ethereum network before interacting with the frontend.

### Key Functions:
- **Voting**: Functionality for casting and counting votes securely.
